"<p>To ensure the integrity of anonymous peer-review, every effort should be "
"made to prevent the identities of the authors and reviewers from being known "
"to each other. This involves the authors, editors, and reviewers (who upload "
"documents as part of their review) checking to see if the following steps "
"have been taken with regard to the text and the file properties:</p>\n"
"<ul><li>The authors of the document have deleted their names from the text, "
"with \"Author\" and year used in the references and footnotes, instead of "
"the authors' name, episode title, etc.</li>\n"
"<li>The authors of the document have removed personal information from the "
"file properties by taking the following steps:\n"
"<ul><li>Microsoft Word for Windows:\n"
"<ul><li>Go to File</li>\n"

"<li>Click on Check for Seasons</li>\n"
